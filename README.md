# MusicPlayer
First attempt at a functional yet primitive music player

App will use the music_folder_location.txt file to navigate to the users music folder and user is expected to go in to the .txt file and copy the full path to their music folder inside of it.

After that the App should work as intended but it can only play (.mp3) files so far and thus the music folder should be set up accordingly
